# Mini-Java-Virtual-Machine
SmallVM.java runs the set of instructions within mySmallVM_prog and accepts different commands used to complete operations and store those within the simulated main memory. Uncomment the output line in main method to see the results print to the output file rather than the console.

Possible commands would be: 

ADD- Adds two given variables/integers and stores within the variable name.

SUB- Subtracts two given variables/integers and stores within the variable name.

MUL- Multiplies two given variables/integers and stores within the variable name.

DIV- Divides two given variables/integers and stores within the variable name.

IN- Receives a user input and stores within the new location with the variable name.

OUT- Uses "" to signify whether to print the variable/integer or statment.

STO- Stores the given variable or integer in a new memory location with the new name.

HALT- Terminates the program.
